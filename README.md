#INSIGHTS AND RECCOMMENDATIONS
1. The bank made a total of $473.1M from the $435.8M it gave out as loans.
That's $37.3M, a 7.9% in profits.

 2. $21.3M (57.1%) of that money came from debt consolidation alone.
Debt consolidation loans also have the highest interest rates.
The bank should disbursing more of this kind of loan.

 3. Most of the bank's business ($83.9M from payment) came from the state of California.
To put it in perspective, second placed New York City raked in just over half ($46.1M) of that for the bank in loan payment.

 4. Debtors with over 10 years of work experience are the most lucrative segment for the bank. Each debtor generated $14190 for the bank.
In second place are newbies who have been in their job less than a year.
This segment did $10392 per person on average.

 5. 60-month loans proved to be much more profitable than the 36-month term.
The bank generated $17251 from each person on average from 60-month terms compared to $10437 it got per person in the 36-month term.

 6. Bad loans (Charged off) accounted for 13.8% of the total loan application.
Bad loans cost the bank $65M. To curtail this, bad loans should be kept at a minimum.
There should be a mechanism in place to identify potential bad debtors early in the process.
